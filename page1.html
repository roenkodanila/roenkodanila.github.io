 <p> Hi, my name is Danila Roenko. This page is supposed to be about me, my education, career, and achievemnts. However, I do not have anough data to show off and write about how I cool I am. So I just will put here the paragraph from my academic paper, so this page does not look too empty. It is not that obvious for me whether Russia is Past, or Present, or Future orientation culture. If we parallel my generation with older generation (e.g. my parents, grandparents), we notice these generations are greatly different (those who was born before the collapse of USSR vs after the collapse). It is fair to say that our parents were born in a different country, where they were past oriented, tied to the past and traditions, and less willing to change. However, new generation of Russians seems to becoming present-oriented society. Russians are not really optimistic about the future and don’t really believe they can shape it, so future-orientation is not the case. Short term benefits, focusing on ‘today’, made me assume Russia is becoming present-oriented.
